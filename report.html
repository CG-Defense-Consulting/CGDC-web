        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The ability of the defense sector to withstand and quickly recover from supply chain disruptions has become a critical national security priority. Recent shocks – from pandemic-induced factory shutdowns to geopolitical conflicts – have exposed how fragile military supply lines can be. In response, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has explicitly recognized the need for “healthy, resilient, diverse, and secure supply chains” to sustain the capabilities vital for national security. Supply chain resilience in defense refers to building an industrial base and logistics network that can anticipate, absorb, and adapt to shocks – whether these arise from natural disasters, market fluctuations, or adversarial actions – without degrading military readiness. Achieving this resilience requires addressing key vulnerabilities in industrial manufacturing, global sourcing, and logistics, while leveraging technology and partnerships to strengthen the supply chain’s integrity. </p>
        
        <p>Today’s defense supply chains are complex global networks. A single advanced weapon system may rely on thousands of components and materials sourced worldwide, from microelectronic chips to specialty alloys and rare minerals. Ensuring resilience is therefore not just a matter of domestic production capacity, but also of managing geopolitical and economic risks across international supply lines. The stakes are high: a supply chain failure could delay critical weapon deliveries or leave warfighters without crucial spare parts. This white paper examines the major challenges undermining defense supply chain resilience – focusing on the United States while also considering international contexts – and outlines strategies for reinforcing these supply chains. The discussion highlights how targeted improvements in the defense industrial base, logistics operations, and global sourcing practices can mitigate risk. Throughout, we connect these insights to the role of expert services and solutions (such as advanced supply chain analytics, risk management frameworks, and strategic planning) in helping defense organizations achieve robust and resilient supply chains. The goal is an analytical yet accessible overview that builds thought leadership in this domain, while subtly underscoring capabilities that can address the identified gaps.</p>

        <h2>Industrial Base Vulnerabilities</h2>
        <p>A strong defense supply chain starts with a robust domestic industrial base – the network of manufacturers, foundries, and suppliers that produce defense materials and components. In recent decades, however, the U.S. defense industrial base has faced significant erosion and outsourcing of critical manufacturing capabilities. Many defense systems now depend on sole-source or foreign suppliers, creating single points of failure. Over time, numerous U.S. suppliers have either exited the market or been out-competed by overseas firms, especially in sectors where foreign producers (notably China) offer lower costs. For example, China’s dominance in heavy industrial manufacturing is stark: China produces more cast and forged metal parts than the next seven countries combined, over four times the output of the United States. As a result, the DoD often relies on foreign sources (including China) for large castings, forgings, and other industrial components used in defense systems. Such dependency poses a strategic vulnerability – if those foreign sources become unavailable due to conflict or trade disruptions, U.S. production of tanks, ships, and aircraft could be delayed or halted.  </p>
